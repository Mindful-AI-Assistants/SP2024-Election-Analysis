This project provides an in-depth analysis of **voting patterns** in the 2024 S√£o Paulo municipal elections, with a focus on the **first and second rounds** of mayoral and city council races. It examines key aspects such as **voter behavior**, **shifts between rounds**, and **regional variations in voter turnout**. 

**The dataset was [***manually compiled from official sources***]()** , includes over **15,000 entries**. To gather relevant data, the project employed **web scraping** techniques, followed by **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. These methods uncover valuable insights into electoral trends and provide **strategic guidance** for understanding the political dynamics of S√£o Paulo, which can inform **future election strategies**


This work was developed as part of the **Integrated Project and Storytelling** course in the second semester of the undergraduate program in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **PUC-SP** in 2024, under the mentorship of the renowned  Professor [‚ú® Rooney Ribeiro Albuquerque Coelho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rooney-coelho-320857182/) 

His **expertise** and **unwavering dedication** to teaching played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of both **data science** and the **art of storytelling**.

### 7.1. Vote Distribution by Municipality

```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Reading the dataset
election = pd.read_csv('/path/to/your/data.csv', encoding='latin-1')

# Plotting vote distribution by municipality
fig = px.histogram(election, x="NM_MUNICIPIO", y="QT_VOTOS", 
                   title="Votes by Municipality", 
                   color_discrete_sequence=["#1f77b4"])
fig.update_layout(bargap=0.2)
fig.show()
